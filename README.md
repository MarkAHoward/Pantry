# Overview
This project was made for me to learn to use Kotlin. I challenged myself to learn how to make
a clas and use different functions in a programming language I had not used before. 
This program allows the user to add items to their pantry and adjust the amounts of them. 
They can them create a shopping list of the things they are out of.

# Development Environment

I used IntelliJ for my IDE and Kotlin for the Programming Language

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}

# Useful Websites

* [Kotlin Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)

# Future Work

* Add a file to store the pantry and read from it so it is not lost when closed.
* Convert this into an app using Android Studio.
